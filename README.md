# Academic R Programming Projects

This repository contains two R programming projects completed during my academic coursework. Below are brief descriptions of the problems solved.

---

## **Problem 1**: Energy Appliances Prediction
- Developed models to predict energy usage (`Y`) based on environmental features (`X1` to `X5`) using a dataset of 671 samples.
- Tasks included:
  - Data visualization with scatter plots and histograms.
  - Data transformation for aggregation.
  - Model fitting using Weighted Arithmetic Mean (WAM), Weighted Power Means (WPM), Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA), and Choquet Integral.
  - Prediction of energy usage for given input values using the best model.

## **Problem 2**: Optimization and Game Theory
- **Part 1**: Optimization for Garment Factory Production
  - Formulated and solved a linear programming (LP) model to maximize profit for shirts and pants production while meeting resource and demand constraints.
  - Used the graphical method for LP visualization and annotated the feasible region and optimal solution.

- **Part 2**: Optimization for Material Use in Product Manufacturing
  - Built and solved an LP model to maximize profit for producing Bloom, Amber, and Leaf products while satisfying demand and material composition constraints.

- **Part 3**: Game Theory for Competitive Bidding
  - Analyzed a two-player zero-sum game between two construction companies.
  - Formulated the payoff matrix and LP model.
  - Solved the game using R to determine the optimal strategy for Company Sky.
